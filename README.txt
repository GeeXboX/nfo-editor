NFO Editor

Requirements :
To compile and run, NFO Editor need the following packages :
- qt4-qmake
- libqtcore4, libqtgui4 
- Maybe others packages related to Qt. I have not yet the exact list
- libvalhalla and libnfo


For compilation, run : 
- qmake then make
- To launch the tool a first time, type where you have compiled , ./nfo-editor


Sorry for the ugly look (and code) and the working which is still unstable, this project has just begun.

Any remarks, thoughts are welcome !
